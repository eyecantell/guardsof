# Frequently Asked Questions: Guardians of Fellowship (For Recipients and Public)

**Who are you and why did you message me?**  
We're a group of Christian volunteers sharing hope and fellowship online. We saw your public post (e.g., using a hashtag like #lonely) and wanted to reach out kindly to say you're not alone. Many people post about struggles hoping for connection. We're here if you'd like to chat, no pressure at all.

**I don't want to talk-please stop contacting me.**  
Absolutely understood. We respect your wishes and won't message again. Take care!

**Is this spam or a scam?**  
No. we're volunteers with no agenda beyond offering encouragement and optional resources (like nowfree.org for hope and local church connections). Messages are always human, personalized, and brief. You can ignore or block if preferred.

**How did you find my post?**  
We monitor public hashtags where people share about loneliness or struggles (e.g., #feelingalone)-places where folks often signal they're open to support. We never monitor private accounts or DMs.

**Can I learn more about your project?**  
Yes! Visit nowfree.org for our mission (sharing Gospel hope and vetted local churches) or guardsof.com (internal hub, login required). We're focused on genuine care, not pressure.

**What if I'm in crisis and need immediate help?**  
Please reach out to professionals: In the US, call/text 988 (Suicide & Crisis Lifeline) or similar local services. We're not trained counselors-just volunteers offering friendly encouragement.

**How do I report if a message felt inappropriate?**  
Reply directly or email [project contact, e.g., support@guardsof.com]-we take feedback seriously and will address it promptly.


# Frequently Asked Questions: Guardians of Fellowship (For Guardians and Partners)

**What is Guardians of Fellowship?**  
A volunteer-led initiative using online tools to proactively (yet gently) reach isolated or struggling people online, offering emotional validation, encouragement, and invitations to Gospel hope/local church fellowship. We start with monitoring public hashtags where people signal need (e.g., #lonely, #feelingalone) and reach out in person to see if we can help.

**Isn't this creepy or intrusive?**  
We understand the concern-unsolicited messages can feel odd. But many people post publicly about loneliness precisely because they're seeking connection (e.g., using hashtags like #lonely). We're there to help those who want it: leading with validation ("I hear how tough that sounds-you're not alone"), offering opt-outs always ("No pressure to reply"), and disengaging gracefully if uninterested. Some will be genuinely grateful for the kind interaction; others just get a brief witness of care. We never pressure, preach aggressively, or access private data - only public posts, with full human oversight.

**How is this different from spam or bots?**  
All messages are human-written and/or human reviewed, personalized, brief, and validation-first-not bulk, salesy, or automated. We comply strictly with platform TOS, prioritize consent/opt-outs, and focus on empathy over conversion.

**What if someone tells me to leave them alone or reacts negatively?**  
Respect it immediately: stop contacting, report to moderators if hostile, and debrief in small groups. Rejection is expected; it's part of sowing seeds kindly. We're playing the long game: one deep church connection can take months but changes lives eternally.

**Is this safe for guardians emotionally?**  
Yes, with safeguards: Workload caps (e.g., 5-10 outreaches/day max), mandatory training on boundaries/burnout, small encouragement groups for debriefing/prayer, and option to pause. Dealing with heavy topics is taxing, so we emphasize prayer, celebrating small wins (e.g., a kind reply), and framing success as faithful obedience over quick results.

**Do you use AI to "spy" on people?**  
No. We monitor public hashtags where people explicitly signal need. AI assists with suggestions only; humans curate everything. Future AI enhancements will include strong human feedback loops to minimize errors, but no provate data is accessed.

**How do you measure success?**  
Primary: Actual church connections (via optional surveys/guardian follow-ups) - the ultimate win of helping someone find lasting fellowship in Christ. 
Secondary: Good seed sown (sustained exchange or resource shares), response rates. Pilot goals: 1-5 deep connections in first 3-6 months. We prepare for low visible success rates, focusing on eternal impact.

**What happens in a crisis situation (e.g., suicidal ideation)?**  
Follow our crisis protocol: Validate feelings and show care, but gently direct to professional help (e.g., 988 lifeline). Report internally for prayer/support.

**Can recipients report unwanted outreach?**  
Yes. We include easy opt-out in messages and at nowfree.org. We always want to improve so we diligently monitor feedback and adjust.

**How is guardian privacy protected?**  
Using the social media tools we provide is purely optional, and while we check for messages you post, we can't post for you or read your DMs. You have complete control of what we can see and do.
