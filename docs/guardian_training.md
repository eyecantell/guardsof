  - Core videos: ~45-60 minutes.
  - Live role-play/Q&A: ~45-60 minutes.
  - Total initial: 1.5-2 hours (spread over 1-2 sessions if needed).
- **Delivery**: Video modules (recorded for replay) + live facilitation.
- **Who Trains**: Project founder/moderators initially; senior guardians/partners as we scale.
- **Certification**: Complete videos + live session participation; ongoing small group involvement required.
- **Ongoing**: Quarterly 30-min refreshers + small group discussions.
