# Crisis Protocol: Handling Serious Situations in Outreach

## Purpose
To equip Guardians with clear, compassionate steps for responding to recipients who disclose or hint at serious crises (e.g., suicidal ideation, self-harm, abuse, severe mental health struggles). We are not trained counselors-our role is to validate feelings, offer immediate care, and direct to professionals. This protocol prioritizes recipient safety, guardian boundaries, and legal/ethical compliance.

## Key Principles
- **Validate and Care**: Always acknowledge feelings without judgment ("I'm really sorry you're going through this-it sounds incredibly hard").
- **Do Not Counsel**: Avoid giving advice, diagnosing, or promising solutions. We offer encouragement and resources only.
- **Direct to Professionals**: Gently guide to crisis hotlines/services.
- **Disengage Gracefully**: If crisis escalates, prioritize handover and step back.
- **Internal Reporting**: Log for team prayer/support (anonymized); never share publicly.
- **Guardian Self-Care**: Debrief immediately in small group or with moderator if needed.

## Recognizing a Crisis
Common indicators in conversations:
- Direct statements: "I want to end it," "I can't go on," "I'm planning to hurt myself."
- Indirect hints: Repeated hopelessness, goodbye-like messages, mentions of self-harm/abuse.
- Sudden escalation: From casual chat to intense despair.

If in doubt, treat as potential crisis.

## Step-by-Step Response Protocol
1. **Pause and Validate**:
   - Respond empathetically: "I hear how much pain you're in right now-you're not alone, and I'm glad you shared this."
   - Do not probe for details (e.g., avoid "Tell me more" or "What’s your plan?").

2. **Offer Immediate Professional Help**:
   - Share crisis resources promptly:
     - US: "Please reach out to the Suicide & Crisis Lifeline. Call/text 988 (free, 24/7, confidential)."
     - International: Suggest local equivalents (e.g., Samaritans UK: 116 123; list in guardsof.com resources).
     - General: "There are trained professionals who can help right now-hotlines like these are great first steps."
   - Provide link if appropriate (e.g., 988lifeline.org).

3. **Disengage from Deeper Sharing**:
   - Avoid Gospel/resource sharing in active crisis: "I'm not a counselor, but these professionals can support you best right now."
   - If they insist on continuing: Gently redirect ("I'd love to chat more later if you're up for it, but please talk to experts first").
   - End conversation positively: "Take care-praying for you."

4. **Log and Report Internally**:
   - In guardsof.com CRM: Tag as "Crisis" (anonymized-no personal details beyond public post link).
   - Notify moderation team/small group leader immediately for prayer and follow-up support.
   - Do not attempt follow-up yourself unless cleared (rare).

5. **Guardian Debrief**:
   - After interaction: Pause outreach, pray, debrief with group/moderator.
   - If heavy impact: Take a break (workload caps enforced).

## Prohibited Actions
- Do not promise confidentiality if safety risk (we may need to report imminent harm, though rare in anonymous online context).
- Do not share personal contact info.
- Do not engage in ongoing crisis counseling.
- Do not ignore-always respond with resources.

## Training and Resources
- Covered in mandatory guardian training (role-playing scenarios).
- Quick-reference card in guardsof.com dashboard.
- Partner resources: Links to 988, Crisis Text Line (text HOME to 741741), international equivalents.

## Accountability
- Moderators review crisis-tagged logs for protocol adherence.
- Annual review/update based on guardian feedback and best practices (e.g., from Chatnow/Anthem of Hope).

This protocol ensures we love well without overstepping-pointing people to help while protecting everyone involved.
