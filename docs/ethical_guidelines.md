# Ethical Guidelines: Ensuring Responsible Outreach

## Purpose
To establish a framework for ethical, transparent, and respectful operations in the Guardians of Fellowship project, ensuring alignment with the mission to show love, foster fellowship, and share the Gospel non-intrusively while complying with legal and platform-specific rules.

## Core Principles
- **Respect and Consent**: Always seek explicit recipient consent for logging private conversations or sending follow-up surveys (e.g., "May we share this anonymously for team learning?" or "Mind if we check in later?"). Provide clear opt-outs in every interaction (e.g., "No pressure to reply"). For guardians, obtain informed consent for optional read-only OAuth connection to their own X account.
- **Privacy Protection**: Anonymize all shared data (e.g., redact usernames, locations, personal details) in guardsof.com logs and "iron sharpens iron" discussions. Store minimal data (e.g., public post links over full transcripts) in the CRM. Auto-detection features access only the guardian's own public tweets (with their consent) and never recipient data.
- **Non-Intrusive Engagement**: Prioritize emotional validation and listening over preaching; avoid bulk messaging, salesy tones, or any automated posting in MVP phases to prevent alienation. All initial outreach and follow-ups are manual (copy/paste in native apps) for authentic human touch.
- **Platform Compliance**: Strictly adhere to each platform’s Terms of Service (TOS) and Acceptable Use Policy (AUP). Use approved APIs only for reading public posts and (with guardian consent) their own timelines; no scraping or unauthorized automation. Confirm all manual uploads are public content.
- **Guardian Safety**: Train Guardians on handling emotional burnout, hostility, or heavy topics; provide debriefing support, cooldown periods, and small encouragement groups.
- **Resource Integrity**: Vet all churches and resources listed on nowfree.org to ensure reliability and alignment with Gospel values.

## Implementation
- **Data Handling**: Encrypt all sensitive data (CRM records, OAuth tokens); use minimal scopes for guardian OAuth (tweet.read, users.read, offline.access). Comply with CCPA and similar laws, even for public data, to minimize risks. Auto-logging of sent replies limited to confirming guardian's own public actions via timeline checks.
- **Conversation Sharing**: Require Guardians to confirm TOS compliance via a checklist in the manual upload form. Moderators review shared logs for sensitive content and full anonymization.
- **OAuth Authorization**: Guardians optionally connect their X account (one-time, revocable) for auto-logging benefits; clearly explain purpose (accurate metrics without manual entry), minimal data access (their own public tweets only), encryption, and revocation options during onboarding.
- **Training**: Mandate ethics training for all Guardians, covering privacy, consent (including OAuth), empathetic outreach, manual workflow, and case studies from similar ministries (e.g., Chatnow’s listening protocols).
- **Transparency**: Display clear privacy policies on guardsof.com and nowfree.org; inform recipients of the project’s mission in initial outreach (e.g., "We’re a group sharing hope and fellowship"). Explain guardian OAuth in onboarding materials.
- **Monitoring**: Conduct annual TOS reviews for platforms; consult legal experts for evolving data/AI laws and OAuth best practices.

## Accountability
- **Moderation Team**: Oversee shared conversations and OAuth-related logs; flag/remove non-compliant or sensitive content.
- **Feedback Loop**: Use sprout ratings, Guardian discussions, and OAuth consent rates to reinforce ethical practices; address violations or concerns promptly.
- **Partnerships**: Collaborate with organizations like Lausanne Movement for ethical AI, outreach, and digital privacy frameworks.

## Metrics
- Track consent rates (e.g., % of chats approved for logging, % of guardians authorizing OAuth).
- Monitor TOS/privacy compliance incidents (aim for zero violations).
- Evaluate Guardian feedback on training effectiveness, OAuth usability, and overall ethical comfort.

*Updated: January 04, 2026 – Added provisions for optional guardian read-only OAuth (consent, minimal scopes, encryption, revocation), clarified auto-detection limits to guardian's own public tweets, reinforced manual outreach execution, and updated training/transparency for new MVP workflow.*
