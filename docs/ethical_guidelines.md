# Ethical Guidelines: Ensuring Responsible Outreach

## Purpose
To establish a framework for ethical, transparent, and respectful operations in the Guardians of Fellowship project, ensuring alignment with the mission to show love, foster fellowship, and share the Gospel non-intrusively while complying with legal and platform-specific rules.

## Core Principles
- **Respect and Consent**: Always seek recipient consent for logging private conversations (e.g., "May we share this anonymously for team learning?"). Provide clear opt-outs in every interaction (e.g., "No pressure to reply").
- **Privacy Protection**: Anonymize all shared data (e.g., redact usernames, locations) in guardsof.com logs and "iron sharpens iron" discussions. Store minimal data (e.g., links, not full transcripts) in the CRM.
- **Non-Intrusive Engagement**: Prioritize emotional validation and listening over preaching; avoid bulk messaging or salesy tones to prevent alienation.
- **Platform Compliance**: Adhere to each platform’s Terms of Service (TOS) and Acceptable Use Policy (AUP), using APIs for automated pulls (e.g., X.com API for #nowfree tracking) and confirming manual uploads are public.
- **Guardian Safety**: Train Guardians on handling emotional burnout, hostility, or heavy topics; provide debriefing support and cooldown periods.
- **Resource Integrity**: Vet all churches and resources listed on nowfree.org to ensure reliability and alignment with Gospel values.

## Implementation
- **Data Handling**: Use encryption for CRM data; comply with CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act) and similar laws, even for public data, to minimize risks.
- **Conversation Sharing**: Require Guardians to confirm TOS compliance via a checklist in the manual upload form on guardsof.com. Moderators review shared logs for sensitive content.
- **Training**: Mandate ethics training for Guardians, covering privacy, consent, and empathetic outreach. Include case studies from similar ministries (e.g., Chatnow’s listening protocols).
- **Transparency**: Display a clear privacy policy on both guardsof.com and nowfree.org; inform recipients of the project’s mission in initial outreach (e.g., "We’re a group sharing hope and fellowship").
- **Monitoring**: Conduct annual TOS reviews for platforms (X.com, Reddit, etc.); consult legal experts for evolving data laws.

## Accountability
- **Moderation Team**: Oversee shared conversations; flag/remove non-compliant or sensitive logs.
- **Feedback Loop**: Use sprout ratings and Guardian discussions to reinforce ethical practices; address violations promptly.
- **Partnerships**: Collaborate with orgs like Lausanne Movement for ethical AI and outreach frameworks.

## Metrics
- Track consent rates (e.g., % of chats approved for logging).
- Monitor TOS compliance incidents (aim for zero violations).
- Evaluate Guardian feedback on training effectiveness.
