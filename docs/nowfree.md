# Nowfree.org: Public Gospel Resource Hub

## Purpose
A welcoming, mobile-optimized site to share the Gospel, guide next steps, and connect people to vetted local resources (starting with Woodland Park, CO churches and Bible studies). Acts as the referral destination for Guardians’ outreach, ensuring accessibility and non-pushy tone.

## Key Features
- **Gospel Walkthrough**: Simple explanation of Jesus’ life, sacrifice, and invitation to faith, using text and curated videos (e.g., "Why bad things happen to good people").
- **Next Steps**: Clear actions for seekers (e.g., prayer guides, Bible reading plans).
- **Resource Database**: Geo-filtered list of churches, Bible studies, and online fellowships, starting with Woodland Park partners. Include contact info, service times, and virtual options.
- **Engagement Tools**: Optional sign-up for follow-up emails or texts (with consent); links to live chat services (e.g., Chatnow) for immediate support.

## Design Principles
- **Simplicity**: Clean, intuitive layout; avoid jargon or heavy theology to welcome diverse backgrounds.
- **Accessibility**: Mobile-first; support screen readers; multilingual options for future expansion.
- **Trustworthy**: Transparent about mission; vetted resources to ensure reliability; no aggressive calls-to-action.
- **Privacy**: Minimal data collection (e.g., optional email); CCPA-compliant; clear privacy policy.

## Development Plan
- **Phase 1**: Static site with core pages (Gospel, Next Steps, Resources). Partner with local churches for initial list.
- **Phase 2**: Add dynamic search for resources (e.g., ZIP code filter). Integrate analytics for click tracking (anonymized).
- **Phase 3**: Expand content (e.g., topical videos, testimonies); add multilingual support for broader reach.

## Partnerships
- Collaborate with Woodland Park churches for resource vetting and referrals.
- Explore links to established ministries (e.g., Peace With God) for supplemental content.
- Engage legal experts to ensure compliance with data laws.
