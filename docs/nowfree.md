# Nowfree.org: Public Gospel Resource Hub

## Purpose
A welcoming, mobile-optimized, public-facing website designed to serve as the primary referral destination for Guardians' outreach. It provides a clear, non-pushy presentation of the Gospel, practical next steps for seekers, and connections to vetted local church communities—starting in Woodland Park, CO. The ultimate goal is to help individuals experiencing isolation or life's struggles find lasting hope in Christ and meaningful fellowship through joining a local church family.

## Key Features
- **Gospel Walkthrough**: 
  - Simple, jargon-free explanation of Jesus’ life, sacrifice, resurrection, and invitation to faith.
  - Supported by curated short videos (e.g., on hope, suffering, forgiveness) to meet people emotionally where they are.

- **Next Steps**:
  - Gentle guidance for new or exploring believers: sample prayers, Bible reading plans, and encouragement to take small steps.
  - Links to trusted live support options (e.g., Chatnow or similar) for immediate conversation.

- **Resource Database**:
  - Geo-filtered directory of vetted local churches, Bible studies, and fellowships.
  - Starts focused on Woodland Park and surrounding areas, with details like service times, virtual options, contact info, and brief descriptions.
  - Future expansion: ZIP code or location-based search for broader regional coverage.

- **Engagement & Impact Tools**:
  - Optional sign-up for light follow-up emails/texts (with clear consent and easy unsubscribe).
  - Anonymized, optional feedback surveys (e.g., "How are you doing now?" or "Did you connect with a church?") to help Guardians measure real-life impact.
  - Links to share personal stories or request prayer (routed ethically).

## Design Principles
- **Simplicity & Warmth**: Clean, intuitive layout that feels safe and welcoming to people from any background; avoids heavy theology or aggressive calls-to-action.
- **Accessibility**: Mobile-first design; full screen-reader support; high contrast and semantic markup; multilingual framework ready for future expansion.
- **Trust-Building**: Transparent mission statement; clear privacy policy; only vetted, reliable resources listed.
- **Low Pressure**: Resources offered as helpful options, never as obligations; emphasis on "you're not alone" tone.

## Development Plan
- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Static core pages (Gospel, Next Steps, Woodland Park church list). Partner with local churches for initial vetting and content.
- **Phase 2**: Add dynamic geo-search for resources; integrate anonymized analytics and optional survey/feedback forms.
- **Phase 3**: Expand content library (topical videos, testimonies); add multilingual support; deepen integration with guardsof.com referral tracking (e.g., church connection reports).

## Partnerships & Sustainability
- Close collaboration with Woodland Park churches for resource vetting, referrals, and mutual support.
- Explore content licensing or links with established ministries (e.g., Peace With God videos, Billy Graham resources).
- Position nowfree.org as a shared asset: Partner churches can promote it confidently, knowing it directs seekers directly to them.

## Success Metrics Tied to Overall Mission
- Primary: Reported connections to local churches (via optional surveys, guardian follow-ups, or church feedback).
- Secondary: Resource page views/clicks, video completions, survey responses indicating positive impact.
- Long-term: Stories of lives changed and new believers integrated into fellowship.
